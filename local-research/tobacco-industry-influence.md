Querying Perplexity AI using sonar-pro for: Find research and data about tobacco industry influence on FDA food regulations and food additive policies, including lobbying data and industry connections.
The tobacco industry has exerted significant influence on FDA regulations and policies related to tobacco products, but there is limited evidence of direct influence on food regulations and food additive policies specifically. Some key points:

- Tobacco companies registered 927 state-level lobbying registrations in 2023, employing 856 lobbyists or lobbying firms[4]. However, this lobbying was focused on tobacco regulations, not food policies.

- The FDA has authority to regulate tobacco products under the 2009 Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act[5]. This law gives FDA power over tobacco manufacturing, marketing and sales, but does not extend to food regulations.

- There is evidence of a "revolving door" between FDA and the tobacco industry, with former FDA lawyers joining tobacco companies to fight regulations[2]. But this appears limited to tobacco-specific roles.

- The tobacco industry has successfully delayed or weakened some FDA tobacco regulations through lawsuits and lobbying[4][6]. However, there's no clear evidence this extends to food additive policies.

- FDA's Center for Tobacco Products is funded by user fees from tobacco companies[5], creating a potential conflict of interest. But this funding structure does not apply to FDA's food regulation activities.

In summary, while the tobacco industry heavily lobbies on tobacco issues, there is little concrete evidence of tobacco industry influence specifically on FDA food regulations or food additive policies based on the provided search results. More targeted research would be needed to uncover any such connections.
