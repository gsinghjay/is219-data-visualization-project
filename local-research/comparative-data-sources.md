The FDA's Substances Added to Food inventory (formerly EAFUS) contains over 3,000 substances that can be added to food in the US[2]. In contrast, the EU Food Additives Database lists approximately 300 approved food additives[3][10].

Some key differences in banned additives:

- Potassium bromate: Banned in the EU, China, and India but allowed in the US[1][6].
- Titanium dioxide: Banned in the EU since 2022 but still permitted in the US[6].
- Propylparaben: Banned as a food additive in the EU since 2006 but allowed in the US[6].

The EU takes a more precautionary approach, requiring additives to be proven safe before approval[4][9]. The US generally considers additives safe until proven otherwise[9].

A 2024 scientific paper noted that the EU has a more structured, centralized system for additive approval via EFSA, while the US offers more flexibility through the GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe) system[4].

The EU Food Additives Database and guidance documents provide detailed information on approved additives and their conditions of use in the EU[3].
