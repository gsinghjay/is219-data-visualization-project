Querying Perplexity AI using sonar-pro for: Find direct download links for FDA food additive status list and EFSA banned ingredients list in CSV or JSON format. Focus on recent data from official sources.
Unfortunately I could not find direct download links for recent CSV or JSON files containing the FDA food additive status list or EFSA banned ingredients list from official sources. The FDA and EFSA websites provide this information in various formats, but not as easily downloadable data files. Some key findings:

- The FDA Food Additive Status List is available as a PDF, but not in CSV/JSON format[1].

- The FDA Substances Added to Food inventory can be searched online, but a full download is not readily available[3].

- EFSA's OpenFoodTox database contains chemical hazard data, but requires using their dashboard to access[5].

- The FDA Inactive Ingredients Database is available for download as CSV/Excel, but does not contain food additive status information[6].

To get this data in a structured format, you would likely need to scrape the FDA and EFSA websites or use their APIs if available. No simple CSV/JSON downloads of the full lists were found from official sources.
