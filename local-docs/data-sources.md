## Data Relationships
- The US FDA data provides detailed information about indirect food additives and their regulatory status
- The EU database contains information about authorized food additives and their usage limits
- WHO data provides health outcome metrics (obesity, foodborne illness) that can be correlated with regulatory differences
- Combined, these datasets enable analysis of:
  1. Regulatory differences between US and EU
  2. Health outcomes in different regulatory environments
  3. Temporal trends in both regulations and health metrics
  4. Regional variations in food safety approaches

## Data Quality Notes
- All datasets are from authoritative sources (FDA, EU, WHO)
- WHO data includes confidence intervals for statistical reliability
- Temporal coverage varies by dataset
- Geographic coverage includes US, EU member states, and additional European countries
