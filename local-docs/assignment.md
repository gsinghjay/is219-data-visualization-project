# Data Visualization Project: Telling Stories Through Code

## Project Overview

In this advanced front-end development project, you'll create interactive data visualizations using React to explore and communicate insights from real-world data that interests you.

## Project Goals

-   Practice working with real-world datasets
-   Develop skills in data visualization using React
-   Create engaging, interactive ways to communicate information
-   Apply front-end development concepts to solve real problems

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Choose Your Topic

Pick something that genuinely interests you! Here are some example topics to spark ideas:

-   **Environmental:**  "How have global temperatures changed across different continents over the past 50 years?"
-   **Sports:**  "What factors most strongly predict NBA team success?"
-   **Economics:**  "How has the cost of living changed across different US cities?"
-   **Health:**  "Is there a relationship between air quality and respiratory illness rates?"
-   **Technology:**  "How has internet access evolved across different demographics?"

### 2. Form Your Essential Question

Your question should be:

-   Specific and clear
-   Answerable with data
-   Interesting to explore visually

### 3. Find Your Data Sources

Look for data in CSV or JSON format from reliable sources such as:

-   Government databases (data.gov, EU Open Data Portal)
-   Academic institutions
-   International organizations (WHO, World Bank)
-   Public APIs
-   Research institutions

**Tip:**  Make sure your data is recent and from credible sources!

### 4. Create Your GitHub Repository

Your repository should include:

1.  A clear title
2.  Your essential question
3.  Description of your data sources
4.  The actual data files or links to them
5.  Initial thoughts on visualization approaches

## Example Project Setups

### Example 1: Climate Change Impact

-   **Topic:**  Global Climate Change
-   **Essential Question:**  "How do CO2 emissions correlate with global temperature changes across different regions?"
-   **Data Sources:**
    -   NASA Global Temperature Data (CSV)
    -   World Bank CO2 Emissions Data (JSON)
-   **Potential Visualizations:**  Interactive map, time series graphs, comparison charts

### Example 2: Education and Technology

-   **Topic:**  Digital Divide in Education
-   **Essential Question:**  "How does internet access availability correlate with educational outcomes across different socioeconomic groups?"
-   **Data Sources:**
    -   National Education Statistics (CSV)
    -   Internet Access Survey Data (CSV)
-   **Potential Visualizations:**  Heat maps, scatter plots, comparative bar charts

## Submission Requirements

1.  Create your GitHub repository
2.  Include all required components listed above
3.  Submit the repository link in the assignment submission area

## Evaluation Criteria

-   Clear, well-defined research question
-   Quality and relevance of data sources
-   Professional repository organization
-   Potential for meaningful visualization

**Remember:**  The goal is to tell a compelling story with data through visualization. Your project should help viewers understand complex information through clear, interactive visual representations.

## Planning Your Visualizations

### Create Draft Visualizations

Before diving into code, create draft versions of your visualizations using:

-   Microsoft Excel
-   Google Sheets

**Why create drafts?**

-   Test if your data tells the story you want to tell
-   Experiment with different visualization types quickly
-   Identify data cleaning needs early
-   Have a clear target for what you'll build in React

### Choosing the Right Visualization for Economic Data

#### Time Series Economic Data

Best for showing economic trends over time:

-   **Line Charts:**  Housing prices, wage growth, employment rates
-   **Area Charts:**  Market share between traditional vs gig economy
-   **Stacked Area Charts:**  Property ownership distribution changes

#### Economic Comparisons

Best for comparing economic metrics:

-   **Bar Charts:**  Income levels across regions, benefits comparison
-   **Radar Charts:**  Multi-factor economic health indicators
-   **Column Charts:**  Rent burden by region, savings rates

#### Financial Relationships

Best for showing economic correlations:

-   **Scatter Plots:**  Income vs. home ownership, debt vs. savings
-   **Bubble Charts:**  Regional economic indicators with multiple variables
-   **Heat Maps:**  Geographic distribution of economic opportunities

#### Economic Distribution

Best for showing economic composition:

-   **Donut Charts:**  Asset allocation, income sources (limited categories)
-   **Treemaps:**  Market share distribution, expense breakdown
-   **Stacked Bar Charts:**  Income distribution, debt composition

#### Interactive Economic Tools

Best for user engagement:

-   **Calculators:**  Affordability metrics, savings projections
-   **Sliders:**  Timeline analysis, income-based filtering
-   **Interactive Maps:**  Regional economic comparisons, opportunity zones

**Visualization Tips:**

-   Start simple - you can always add complexity later
-   Consider your audience's data literacy level
-   Test your visualization with sample data in Excel/Sheets first
-   Think about what story you want your data to tell
-   Consider combining multiple visualization types for complex datasets

**Remember:**  The goal is to tell a compelling story with data through visualization. Your project should help viewers understand complex information through clear, interactive visual representations.
